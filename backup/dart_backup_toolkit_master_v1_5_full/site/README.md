# Dart Backup Toolkit &mdash; GitHub Pages Site

This folder is a minimal static documentation site for the Dart Backup Reconciliation Toolkit.

To publish via GitHub Pages:

1. Create a repository, e.g. `dart-backup-toolkit`.
2. Copy this `site/` folder into the repo.
3. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Set:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/docs`
5. Move the contents of `site/docs/` into a `docs/` folder at the root of the repo (or adjust GitHub Pages settings accordingly).

After that, your docs will be available at:

`https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`
